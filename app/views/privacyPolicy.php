    <h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>

<h3>Your Privacy Matters</h3>
<p>Welcome to Wealthia, This App is owned and operated by Luxant Limited.
Protecting your privacy is important to us. We take precautions to ensure that
your information is kept private and confidential. To assist us in providing you
the quality services and products that you request or to help meet your needs,
we gather, maintain, and use both public and nonpublic personal information
about you. We are providing you with the following policies and practices with
respect to sharing of customer information.</p><br><br>
<strong>COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY</strong>
<p>
Wealthia believes that the trust of our Partners and Clients are our greatest
asset. That is why we are committed to protecting your privacy and the
confidentiality of your personal information. We are providing this Privacy
Policy to you in an effort to explain our collection, use, retention and security
of your personal information.</p><br><br>
<strong>HOW WE GATHER INFORMATION</strong>

We collect your personal information in the process of establishing and
administering your accounts.

1. Application information. When you create a profile on the Wealthia
App, you provide information to us on your account application. This
information may include your name, address, phone number, email
address, and information about your investment experience,
objectives, current investments, and information we may obtain from
third-parties.
2. Transaction information. Any time you initiate a transaction
through us, we collect information about that transaction.

HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION

Classified as Internal use only

We share your personal information only for our everyday business purposes
– such as to process your requests, maintain your account(s), respond to
court orders and legal investigations– and it is limited to those parties who
assist us in establishing and administering your account. We do not sell your
personal information to anyone.

1. Use of information. We use your personal information to establish
and administer your accounts, to alert you to services we provide,
and to fulfill our regulatory obligations.
2. Sharing information for the purpose of providing service. We
disclose your personal information to our partners who may want to
reach out to you.
3. Sharing information for legal purposes. In certain circumstances,
we may share personal information as required or permitted by law.
We may do so, for example, to cooperate with regulators or law
enforcement authorities, to resolve consumer disputes, or for
institutional risk control.

HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION
Even when we share your personal information, we remain committed to
maintaining your privacy. We take steps to protect confidentiality of personal
information whenever possible.

1. Contractual protections. We have contracts with all of our
employees and with unaffiliated companies with whom we share
personal information, prohibiting them from using such personal
information for any purpose other than that for which it is disclosed,
and further prohibiting them from disclosing it to any other parties.
2. Sharing with affiliates. We do not share personal information with
affiliates unless it is necessary to service your accounts or as
permitted by law.
3. Physical and procedural safeguards. We maintain physical,
electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality
of your personal information. We also restrict employee access to
your personal information to those employees who need to know
that information in the course of their job responsibilities.

PRIVACY ONLINE
We consider privacy, security, and service in our online operations to be just
as critical as in the rest of our business. We therefore employ all of the
safeguards described above, along with the following Internet-specific
practices.
We use a variety of proven protections to maintain the security of your online
session. For example, we make extensive use of firewall barriers, encryption
techniques and authentication procedures. We may also use “cookies” and
similar files that may be placed on your computer’s hard drive for security
purposes, to facilitate App navigation, and to personalize your experience on
our App.
When you visit our App, we may collect technical and navigational
information, such as computer browser type, Internet protocol address, pages,
and average time spent on our App. This information may be used, for
example, to alert you to software compatibility issues; or it may be analyzed to
improve our web design and functionality.
When you visit password-protected areas of our App, we will require you to
enter your individual login ID and password. In such cases, your browsing will
no longer be anonymous to us. However, we will use your personal
information only to provide you with account information or otherwise as listed
above.
While we take active steps to protect all information we receive online, we
cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us via the
Internet. Emails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are
transmitted to us. Therefore, if your communication is very sensitive or
includes highly confidential information such as a social security number or an
account number, it may be prudent for you to use a method of transmission
other than email or otherwise encrypt such information.
Other Information We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy and any
of the policies and procedures listed herein at any time. However, if at any
time in the future it becomes necessary to disclose personal information in a

Classified as Internal use only

way that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, we will give you advance
notice of the proposed change and an opportunity to opt out of such
disclosure. If you are a new customer, we can begin sharing your information
30 days from the date we sent this notice. When you are no longer our
customer, we continue to share your information as described in this notice.
However, you can contact us at any time to limit our sharing.
This Privacy Policy applies to services provided by Wealthia App . Third
parties who provide you with financial services may have policies that differ
from this one. You should contact those companies directly for more
information. The examples and illustrations contained in this Privacy Policy
are illustrations and are not intended to be exclusive.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, please
send a mail to ……………………………
In this Privacy Policy, the words “you” and “customer” are used to indicate any
individual who obtains or has obtained a financial product or service from
Wealthia App that is to be used primarily for personal, family, or household
purposes. The words “personal information” are used to indicate any
nonpublic information that identifies you or your accounts.
UPDATE YOUR INFORMATION
Should you have significant life changes, such as a marriage, birth of a child,
change of contact information, death of a spouse, divorce, or a significant
change in your financial situation, please contact your Wealth Advisor to
determine if such changes will alter your investment objectives, risk tolerance,
or investment horizon.
CODE OF ETHICS

relationship with investors. If you would like a free copy of our Code of Ethics

BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN

Classified as Internal use only

Wealthia App has developed a Business Continuity Plan (the “Plan”) designed
to prevent or mitigate potential business disruption. Since the timing and
severity of events that can lead to business disruption are unpredictable, our
Plan is comprehensive, continually evolving, and practiced on an ongoing
basis.
Our Plan is designed to safeguard our employees and property, protect the
firm’s books and records, allow our advisors and clients to transact business,
and communicate effectively with all stakeholders. Our Plan is also designed
to ensure business is not disrupted and to permit our firm to resume business
as quickly as possible if there is a disruption.
Our Plan addresses data back-up and recovery, critical technology and
communications systems, financial and operational assessments, alternative
communications with advisors, clients, employees and regulators, alternate
physical locations for employees, critical suppliers and contractors, regulatory
reporting, and ensuring prompt access to information if there is a business
disruption.
The objective is to have critical functions operational within one hour.
However, in severe or widespread situations, operations could be delayed for
a longer period of time. In the event of a disruption, we will notify you through
regular communications on our App or via email, if appropriate.
